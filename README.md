# CS50's Introduction to Computer Science - 2020
> Thank you Professor David J. Malan and instructors for this wonderful course!

## Integrity
Please read through CS50's [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/honesty/) policy and do what is reasonable.

With that said, the best way to learn is to implement it yourself. Try to solve the Problem Sets on your own before taking a peek at other people's solutions. Victory will taste sweeter too :)
